    <p>Last updated: 18 February 2016 by <a href="https://twitter.com/dugboticus">@dugboticus</a></p>

    <p>The aim of this page is to run autmated tools against it to see which fails are identified.</p>

    <p>There are 109 fails grouped into 18 categories. This is a work in progress, I'll be adding many more fails.</p>

        Title I of the CARE Act creates a program of formula and supplemental competitive grants to help metropolitan areas
        with 2,000 or more reported AIDS cases meet emergency care needs of low-income HIV patients. Title II of the Ryan
        White Act provides formula grants to States and territories for operation of HIV service consortia in the localities
        most affected bu the epidemic, provision of home and community -based care, continuation of insurance coverage for
        persons with HIV infection, and treatments that prolong life and prevent serious deterioration of health.
        Up to 10 percent of the funds for this program can be used to support Special Projects of National Significance.

    <h2 id="pagelayout">Page Layout</h2>
    <h3>Wide page forces users to scroll horizontally</h3>
    <div class="example example--wide">
        <p class="constrained">When sites are constructed to require 
horizontal scrolling in order to navigate or read content at a normal 
size of 100% using standard screen sizes, additional problems can arise 
for users with low vision or mobility impairments.</p>
        <p style="float:right;">This is some text you have to horizontally scroll to read.</p>

    <h2 id="colourandcontrast">Colour and Contrast</h2>
    <h3>Color alone is used to convey content</h3>

    <h3>Large text does not have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 so does not meet AA</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p class="low-contrast-large-aa">This small text does not have enough contrast with it's background</p>

    <h3>Large text does not have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 so does not meet AAA</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p class="low-contrast-large-aa">This small text does not have enough contrast with it's background</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="typography">Typography</h2>
    <h3>Very small text found</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p class="small-text">This is some tiny text, much too small for some people to read</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Italics used on long sections of text</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p class="italic">Italics are sometimes used to highlight text. 
But you shouldn't use italicized text because they make letters hard to 
read. The letters have a jagged line compared to non-italic fonts. The 
letters also lean over making it hard for dyslexic users to make out the
 words. When the text size is small, the text is even more illegible.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>All caps text found</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p class="all-caps">Typing sentences or phrases IN ALL CAPITALS 
is rarely a good idea. It may make sense under some circumstances, but 
only rarely. Lengthy segments of capitalized content are more difficult 
to read. In some cases, a screen reader may interpret ALL CAPITAL text 
as being an acronym and may read it as letters rather than words. For 
example, a screen reader may read the uppercase text CONTACT US as 
"Contact U. S." because it interprets the uppercase "US" as being an 
acronym for "United States".</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Justified text found</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p class="justify">When text is justified to both margins it may
 add additional spaces between words which may be difficult for users 
with visual or cognitive impairments to read. Full text justification 
can also cause words to be spaced closely together thus making it 
difficult to determine where a word starts and ends.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Inadequate line height used</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p class="line-height">Many people with cognitive disabilities 
have trouble tracking lines of text when a block of text is single 
spaced. Providing spacing between 1.5 to 2 allows them to start a new 
line more easily once they have finished the previous one.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Long lines of text</h3>
    <div class="example example--wide">
        <p>For people with some reading or vision disabilities, long 
lines of text can become a significant barrier. They have trouble 
keeping their place and following the flow of text. Having a narrow 
block of text makes it easier for them to continue on to the next line 
in a block. Lines should not exceed 80 characters</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Blink element found</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <blink>Blinking text and moving text (such as a marquee) can 
distract the reader's attention. This is especially relevant to people 
with attention deficits or cognitive disabilities. Neither is likely to 
cause a seizure, but they are likely to decrease the readability of the 
document as a whole and increase the time it takes for users to finish 
reading it.</blink>
    </div>

    <h3>Marquee element found</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <marquee>The BLINK and MARQUEE element animates content in a way that cannot be overridden or disabled by the user.</marquee>

    <div class="example">
        <a href="http://aduggin.github.io/accessibility-fails/missing.html">Example page with no H1</a>
    </div>

    <h3>Headings not structured in a hierarchical manner</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        <p>Pages should be structured in a hierarchical manner, generally with one 1st degree headings (h1) being the
        most important (usually page titles or main content heading), then 2nd degree headings (h2 - usually major
            section headings), down to 3rd degree headings (sub-sections of the h2), and so on. </p>

        <h5>Heading 5</h5>
        <p>Technically, lower degree headings should be contained within headings of the next highest degree
            (i.e., one should not skip heading levels, such as from an h2 to an h4, going down the document).</p>

        <h4>Heading 4</h4>
        <p>This is an example where heading levels have been skipped and are not in a logical order, which makes the page
            difficult to understand and navigate for people using assitive technologies such as screen reader.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Empty heading</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <h4></h4>
        <p>This paragraph is preceded by an empty H4</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Text formatting  used instead of an actual heading</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="fake-heading">Fake Heading</div>
        <p>This paragraph is preceded by a div that is styled to look like a heading</p>
